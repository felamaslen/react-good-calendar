# react-good-calendar

A React component for rendering a customisable calendar.

## Architecture

React app.

The `date-fns` package is used for date manipulation.

## Development

To run a development server:

`npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, so all the `react-scripts` features are available.

TODO: package this up as an npm package and publish it.
